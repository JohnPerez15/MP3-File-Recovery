This is an mp3 file recovery program for the ext3 filesystem.
The first 5 steps is to prepare the drive for the program.
Step 1:
	Make sure the drive is completely wiped or zeroed out.
Step 2:
	Make a 2GB partition in your drive with no filesystem set,
	if ext3 is not available.
Step 3:
	If ext3 was not available in the previous step. In command 
	line use the (sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sda1) command to set the 
	filesystem to ext3. In you case the "a" in /dev/sda1
	may differ. You can check the name of the partition with
	the command lsblk.
Step 4:
	Save the mp3 file to the partition and unmount the drive.
Step 5:
	mount the drive and delete the file from the partition. Then
	unmount the drive.

The following step is running the command. This program takes in two arguments.
The first is the drive we are recovering the file from. The second is the file
we are recovering the file to. In this directory I have provided a clean file 
called Recovered.mp3. This is where we will recover the file to.

Step 6:
	In command line use the command make. this will compile the program.
	Using the command ls you can check if the executable "proj" is added.
Step 7:
	The next step is to run the program. In command line run the command
	sudo ./proj /dev/sda ./Recovered.mp3
	to run the program. In this case again the name of the drive maybe
	different use the command lsblk to check if this is the name of the
	drive. Similarily, you can change the location of the recovery file.
	Make sure the set path is correct.
Step 8:
	The program may take time to run depending on the size of the file.
	Once it is complete you can see that the recovery file you created has
	changed to the the deleted mp3 file in the files program.
